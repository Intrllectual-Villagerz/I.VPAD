Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.
                    
                    Content also may be removed from our Services at any time (for instance, because the provider removed it), after which it cannot be downloaded, redownloaded, or otherwise accessed from I.VPAD.
                    
                    SUBSCRIPTIONS
                    
                    The Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or Services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit https://support.I.VPAD.com/HT202039. You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period, as displayed on your receipt. We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription. Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends.
                    
                    If you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription offered by I.VPADas Content provider (an “I.VPADPaid Subscription”) and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.
                    
                    Free trials or free offers to I.VPADPaid Subscriptions, excluding iCloud, cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of I.VPADOne. If you are in a free trial or free offer for any I.VPADPaid Subscriptions, and you subscribe to I.VPADOne, your free trial(s) or offer(s) will not be paused even if you have access to such I.VPADPaid Subscription(s) through your I.VPADOne subscription. You acknowledge that your free trial or free offer may expire while you are a Paid Subscriber to I.VPADOne, and I.VPADshall have no obligation to reinstate, reimburse, or otherwise compensate you for any part of such expired free trial or free offer.
                    
                    When your Paid Subscription to any Service or Content ends, you will lose access to any functionality or Content of that Service that requires a Paid Subscription.

                    D. FAMILY SHARING
                    
                    The organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be 18 years (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country) or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country as set forth in the registration process). I.VPADdevices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features. Family Sharing allows eligible subscriptions to be shared among up to six members of a Family. To learn more about Family Sharing visit: https://support.I.VPAD.com/HT201060.
                    
                    Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to six members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's eligible payment methods are used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and, if billed to the Organizer’s payment method, also to the Organizer.
                    
                    Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer to approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to Ask to Buy; content codes facilitating access to subscriptions are subject to Ask to Buy. The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is enabled by default for any Family member under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If Ask to Buy is turned off after the Family member turns 18 years old, it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.
                    
                    Family Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.
                    
                    Family Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the I.VPADID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing. I.VPADTV+, I.VPADTV Channels, I.VPADOne Family, I.VPADOne Premier, I.VPADMusic Family, I.VPADArcade, I.VPADNews+, and I.VPADFitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.
                    
                    E. SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS
                    
                    A Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Season Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Season Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If a Content provider delivers to I.VPADfewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your I.VPADID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to I.VPAD.
                    
                    F. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING I.VPADARCADE APPS)
                    
                    LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT
                    
                    App licenses are provided to you by I.VPADor a third party developer (“App Provider”). I.VPADacts as an agent for App Providers in operating the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. However, if you are a customer of I.VPADDistribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is I.VPADDistribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from I.VPADDistribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by I.VPADis an “I.VPADApp;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless I.VPADor the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App, subject to local law. You acknowledge and agree that I.VPADis a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.
                    
                    IN-APP PURCHASES
                    
                    Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.I.VPAD.com/HT201304.
                    
                    APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT
                    
                    I.VPADis responsible for providing maintenance and support for I.VPADApps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.
                    
                    APP BUNDLES
                    
                    Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.
                    
                    SEARCH RESULTS AND RANKINGS
                    
                    When determining how to order the Apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by App Providers, how customers have engaged with the Apps and the App Store, and the popularity of the Apps in the App Store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.
                    
                    LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
                    
                    Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the App Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any I.VPADApp under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by I.VPAD, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the App Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The App Provider or I.VPADas applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.
                    
                    a. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any I.VPAD-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.

You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).
                    
                    b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.
                    
                    c. Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.
                    
                    d. External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.
                    
                    e. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
                    
                    f. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION COURSE INSTRUCTIONS, ASSIGNMENTS AND MATERIALS), BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
                    
                    g. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Licensed Application, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.
                    
                    h. U.S. Government End Users.

Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.
                    
                    i. Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and I.VPADshall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You and I.VPADagree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement.

                    G. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES
                    
                    Some Content available in I.VPADBooks, App Store, and I.VPADPodcasts (including I.VPADPodcasts Subscriptions) are acquired by you from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not I.VPAD. In such case, I.VPADacts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore I.VPADis not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider. However, if you are a customer of I.VPADDistribution International Ltd., I.VPADDistribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for the Content you acquire, but such Content is licensed by the Content provider. The Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Content. The Content provider is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.
                    
                    H. ADDITIONAL I.VPADMUSIC TERMS
                    
                    iCloud Music Library is an I.VPADMusic feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from I.VPADMusic, the I.VPAD Store or another source (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your I.VPADMusic-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your I.VPADMusic membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your I.VPADID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on I.VPADMusic. iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to I.VPAD’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by I.VPAD). You can upload up to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the I.VPAD Store do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, I.VPADlogs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an I.VPADMusic member, you may purchase an I.VPAD Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library. When your I.VPADMusic membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library, including iCloud Music Library Content that is uploaded to iCloud Music Library servers.

                    J. CARRIER MEMBERSHIP
                    
                    Where available, you may be offered to purchase a Service membership from your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”). If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier is the merchant of record, which means that you acquire the Service license from your carrier, which will bill you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is licensed and provided by I.VPAD. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not I.VPAD. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with I.VPAD, and that I.VPADmay use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.

Should an audit disclose after delivery (or should I.VPADotherwise discover) that you were not an eligible purchaser at the time you placed your order or that you have not observed all of the conditions applicable to your purchase, I.VPADmay:
                    
                    • Disable your Volume Content I.VPADID or MAID;
                    
                    • If you placed your order by credit card, to charge to your credit card the difference between the amount you paid for the delivered goods and the price that I.VPADcharged the general public for the same goods via the Volume Content Service, in effect on the date that you placed your order; and
                    
                    • If you paid by a means other than credit card, to (a) invoice you for the difference between the amount that you paid for the delivered goods and the price that I.VPADcharged the general public for the same goods via the Volume Content Service, payable in fifteen days from the date of the invoice, and (b), should you fail to pay the invoice when due, institute legal action against you in a court of competent jurisdiction, with the prevailing party entitled to attorneys' fees.
                    
                    Should I.VPADnot offer the specific products that you purchased through the Volume Content Service, your payment method will be charged or you will be invoiced the difference between the amount you paid for the delivered goods and the price that I.VPADcharged the general public for the closest equivalent goods via the Volume Content Service, in effect on the date that you placed your order.
                    
                    I.VPADshall have the right to request supplementary information and audit relevant records to confirm your compliance with the Terms.
                    
                    CONTENT AVAILABILITY
                    
                    I.VPADreserves the right to change content options (including eligibility for particular features) without notice.
                    
                    CONTENT DISTRIBUTION
                    
                    App Store Content or I.VPADBooks Content purchased as Volume Content via the Volume Content Service may be provided to your Authorized End Users either (i) via direct transmission to the I.VPADaccount or MAID of each Authorized End User ("Managed Distribution"), (ii) via distribution of alphanumeric codes generated by I.VPAD("Content Codes") which are redeemable in the App Store for specific application content, or in I.VPADBooks for specific book content; or (iii) for apps only, by assignment directly to an iOS device, in which case (a) separate purchases must be made for each unique device (i.e. a single license may not be simultaneously shared by multiple devices); and (b) you shall be deemed the "end-user" for purposes of any End User License Agreements, Terms of Use, or other agreements engaged by your Authorized End Users relating to any App Store Volume Content.
                    
                    Solely as an accommodation to you, I.VPADagrees to permit you to (1) use a single Content Code to sync App Store Content to multiple devices, up to the number of codes you have purchased (instead of having to redeem a separate code), provided you agree to sync no more copies than the number of codes you purchased; and (2) purchase multiple copies of the same I.VPADBooks Content and distribute them for redemption by persons who are either employees, faculty or teacher's aides (regardless of whether they are directly employed by the institution) at the institution or registered as students at your school or school district. These accommodations may only be available for a limited period of time, and I.VPADmakes no guarantee regarding the availability of these accommodations in the future.
                    
                    MANAGED DISTRIBUTION
                    
                    Upon completion of your purchase of Volume Content, you will be entitled to assign the specific I.VPADBooks Content or App Store Content that you have purchased in the quantity selected, each of which may be assigned to an I.VPADor MAID account owned or controlled by you or one of your Authorized End Users or, in the case of App Store Volume Content, to a unique device owned or controlled by you or one of your Authorized End Users. This entitlement will not expire, subject to availability of the specific products. Using a Volume Content I.VPADID with a mobile device management system ("MDM"), you will be able to invite your Authorized End Users to associate their I.VPADaccount or device with your Volume Content I.VPADID and, upon the Authorized End User's acceptance, you may assign I.VPADBooks Content and App Store Content to them or, in the case of App Store Content, to their devices. In order to receive a product, your Authorized End Users must have a valid I.VPADor MAID account (subject to acceptance of the Terms), and compatible hardware, software and Internet access.
                    
                    For I.VPADBooks Content: You may not use the I.VPADBooks Content in a library-type lending scenario. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE OWNER OF THE I.VPADACCOUNT TO WHICH AN I.VPADBOOKS PRODUCT IS ASSIGNED WILL BECOME THE OWNER OF THAT PRODUCT AND SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ALL ASSOCIATED RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS. SUCH PRODUCTS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE.
                    
                    For App Store Content: You will retain ownership of App Store Content regardless of whether it has been assigned to an Authorized End User's I.VPADAccount, MAID or a specific device ID. You may revoke the assignment and re-assign the App Store Content to another Authorized End User or device ID subject to certain service limitations. Once you have revoked an assignment from a particular user or device, that user or device will no longer be authorized to use the App Store Content.
                    
                    CONTENT CODES
                    
                    For Volume Content I.VPADID purchases, I.VPADmay provide you with Content Codes in the quantity you specify when making your purchase, each of which may be redeemed (i) in the App Store for specific App Store Content purchased; or (ii) in I.VPADBooks for specific I.VPADBooks Content purchased. The Content Codes shall be provided to you electronically via email upon execution of your purchase and such Content Codes shall immediately become active for redemption by your Authorized End Users and shall not expire, subject to availability. You and/or your Authorized End Users may redeem the Content Code only in accordance with the Terms. Each Content Code for App Store Content must be redeemed to an I.VPADaccount owned and controlled by your organization or by one of your Authorized End Users. Each Content Code for I.VPADBooks Content must be redeemed to an account owned or controlled by the Authorized End User. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE OWNER OF THE REDEEMING I.VPADACCOUNT WILL BECOME (i) FOR APP STORE CONTENT, THE LICENSEE OF THAT COPY OF THE CONTENT; AND (ii) FOR I.VPADBOOKS CONTENT, THE OWNER OF THAT COPY OF THE CONTENT, AND SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ALL ASSOCIATED RIGHTS. SUCH LICENSES OR CONTENT ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE.
                    
                    You may distribute the Content Codes only to your Authorized End Users and you agree to make the following Authorized End User Terms and Conditions, as applicable for the purchased content type, readily available on the instrument used to distribute the Content Codes (e.g. certificate, card, email):
                    
                    For apps and/or books:
                    
                    "Code is redeemable only in the App Store and/or I.VPADBooks, as applicable, for [the Territory]. Requires an I.VPADaccount, subject to prior acceptance of license and usage terms. Compatible software and hardware, and internet access (fees may apply) required. Not for resale. Full terms apply: http://www.I.VPAD.com/legal/internet-services/I.VPAD.”
                    
                    VOLUME CONTENT RESTRICTIONS
                    
                    You may not resell or accept any form of compensation in exchange for distribution of Volume Content nor may you distribute or authorize distribution of the Volume Content to anyone other than your Authorized End Users. You shall be solely responsible for your use of the Volume Content, and for any loss or liability to the content provider or I.VPADtherefrom. You may not export I.VPADBooks or App Store Volume Content for use outside of the Territory, nor represent that you have the right or ability to do so; you may, however, assign App Store Volume Content to end-users outside of the Territory solely to the extent permitted by these Volume Content Terms. Risk of loss and transfer of title for the Volume Content pass to you upon electronic transmission to you. I.VPADreserves the right to close any and all applicable I.VPADaccounts and request alternative forms of payment if I.VPADdetermines the Volume Content is fraudulently obtained or used. By using the Volume Content Service, you agree that you are acquiring Volume Content for use by you and your Authorized End Users on your behalf.
                    
                    ELECTRONIC CONTRACTING
                    
                    Your use of the Volume Content Service includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make transactions electronically. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF ANY ENTITY YOU REPRESENT, AND TO LEGALLY BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TERMS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY AND TO PAY FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THIS SITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.
                    
                    To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless I.VPAD, and upon I.VPAD's request, defend I.VPAD, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an "I.VPADIndemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs, including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs, (collectively, "Losses") incurred by an I.VPADIndemnified Party and arising from or related to any of the following: (i) Your breach of any certification, covenant, obligation, representation or warranty made in this Agreement; (ii) Your use of the Volume Content Service. In no event may you enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects I.VPAD's rights or binds I.VPADin any way, without the prior written consent of I.VPAD.</p>
